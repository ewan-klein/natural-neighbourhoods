Natural Neighbourhoods
======================

Fork of City of Edinburgh Council survey data, with goal of visualising natural neighbourhoods. Main developments:

* Geocoded postcodes with lat-long
* Expanded neighbourhoods of the form 'X/Y/Z' into constituents (and replicating the rest of the row)
* Aggregated some specialised neighbourhoods into supercategories; e.g. 'West Pilton' -> 'Pilton'
* Ignored neighbourhoods containing fewer than 10 points.
